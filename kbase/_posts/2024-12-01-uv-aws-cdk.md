## Purpose
The AWS CDK for Python includes a requirements.txt file with the official instructions explaining how to initialise a CDK app with `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file. If you are using the [uv package and project manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/{:target="_blank"}), you may prefer to setup your environment with a `pyproject.toml` and a specific version of Python. This article is a short adaption to the official AWS CDK Tutorial on how to do both!

## Assumptions
+ You have installed the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html{:target="_blank"})
+ You have installed [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/{:target="_blank"})

## Background
The following steps can be used in place of step 1.2 of the official AWS CDK [Tutorial: Create your first AWS CDK app](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html{:target="_blank"}).

## Procedure
1. Ensure that you are in the directory that you wish to use for your AWS CDK app per step 1.1 of the official tutorial.
2. Initialise the CDK app using Python:  
```shell
cdk init app --language python
```
3. Initialise a uv project within the same directory:
```shell
uv init --python 3.12
```
<u>Arguments</u>
>\-\-python [VERSION]
>: Use a specific Python version (3.12 in the above case). This argument is only required if you need to change from your default Python version.

4. Activate the virtual environment:
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, run `.\venv\Scripts\activate` instead
```
5. Add the contents of the CDK `requirements.txt` file to the `pyproject.toml` dependencies:
```shell
uv add -r requirements.txt
```
6. Add the contents of the CDK `requirements-dev.txt` file to the `pyproject.toml` dev dependencies:
```shell
uv add --dev -r requirements-dev.txt
```
7. Remove the requirements files to minimise any future confusion:
```shell
rm -f requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
```
8. Continue with the official AWS CDK Tutorial from [step 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html#hello_world_configure{:target="_blank"}).

## Conclusion
Once the above steps are complete, you should be able to use the [uv CLI](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/{:target="_blank"}) for project and package management in addition to the [AWS CDK CLI commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html{:target="_blank"}) from within the project directory.
