  10+ years of IT ops has shown me that you can never stop learning.
  I need to know how things work and am ever searching for the satisfaction that comes from solving a problem.
  I currently live, work, and study (mechatronic engineering) in Brisbane, Australia.

10+ years of IT ops has shown me that you can never stop learning.

A side effect of learning and trying new things is that the infrequently used is so frequently forgotten... So after way too many years of bookmarking pages, re-Googling solutions, and working from faulty memory I've challenged my insanity and created this blog. To that end, the first purpose of this place is to document that thing I did in the now so I can easily find it again in the future. If that helps someone else do that thing too, so much the better.

The other purpose of this blog is to document my personal projects so that others might benefit and I can grow as an engineer. In 2019 I decided that after a childhood of consuming way too much SciFi, my dream of working on space stuff needed to be realised. This lead to my enrolment in a second Bachelor barely six months after finishing the first (or am I just a glutton for punishment?). Since then, I've learnt (and definitely forgotten) a lot and I think I'm just knowledgeable enough to be dangerous. So my hope is to put some of that knowledge to use on my own projects and share them here.

This place is a work in progress and I most certainly wont get everything right but as I was told in my very first semester, fail fast and fail often because it's one of the best ways to learn.
